This file contains descriptions of the files contained in the teal test 
directory.

----------------- TEST FILES --------------
In general, each test has a testbench (*.sv) and a HDL (*.v) component. 

---- dictionary_test.sv  memory_test.sv  vout_test.sv  vrandom_test.sv -----

These test are real simple exercisers to make sure the basic functionality 
works. 

They are also good places to see some of Teal's basic, non simulator 
dependent capabilities.
